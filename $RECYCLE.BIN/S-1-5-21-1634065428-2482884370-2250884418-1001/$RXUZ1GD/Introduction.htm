  ---------- <font color="#00FFFF">About Sim8085 </font> ----------</p>
<p> Sim8085 is an integrated program that collects three features in one:</p>
<p><img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">First, it 
  is an editor. You can use this editor like the &quot;NotePad&quot; program of 
  Windows. (may be more than that ! ;-) ) <br>
  <img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">Second, it is 
  a compiler. You can compile (or say syntax checking) your code from inside the 
  editor. <br>
  <img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">Third, it is 
  a debugger. You can debug your code, just like your code runs on a 8085 Cpu. 
  Here, you can observe the registers or any memory content. You can also change 
  the values or even the code itself within debugger ! </p>
<p> As mentioned before, in the 'Copyright Notice', this program is written 
  for educational purposes only. It is written because there is no such a program 
  that runs under Windows, and flexible, for using 
  as an assistant with our &quot;Microprocessor Architecture and Programming&quot; 
  course. It is thought that, Sim8085 will be enough according to lesson content, 
  hence it is designed NOT to be so complicated.<br>
  <br>
  When designing both the Sim8085 and this help file, the course book &quot;Microprocessor 
  Architecture, Programming, and Applications with the 8085/8085A&quot; is taken 
  as a reference. (Ramesh S. Gaonkar, second edition)</p>

  <a name="Requirements"></a><br>
  ---------- <font color="#00FFFF">System Requirements</font> ----------</p>
<p>Your computer must have the following minimum requirements :</p>

  higher microprocessor<br>
  <img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">At least 3 MB 
  free memory<br>
  <img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">At least 2MB 
  free hard disk space (for installation)<br>
  <img src="dot.gif" width="10" height="10" hspace="4" border="0">Mouse or an 
  other equivalent pointing device &nbsp;[ for your nerves of course :-) ]<br>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;On the fly&quot; code manipulation in the debug mode will be improved. </li>
  <li>Total execution time of the instractions will be calculated and displayed in the debug mode. &micro;p clock frequency will be able to entered by the user. </li>
  <li>Simple &quot;code execution delay calculator&quot; will be added. According to the entered values of  &micro;p clock frequency and required delay time, loop counters will be calculated.</li>
  <li>Debugger window layout will be redesigned so, user will be able to resize it. </li>
